            I am Alexis Thai, a first-year architecture student at NJIT. I was born in New Jersey and grew up there. Growing up, I always loved to do arts and crafts. I first started off with playng play dough and branched out to things like crocheting, ceramics, making jewerly and more. Same thing can be said about intruments. I first started to learn the piano when I was in first grade and eventually decided to also learn the guitar and ukulele as I grew up. <br> I decided to major in Architecture because I was always interested in hands on projects and buildings, especially houses. I had prior experience with designing and builing either through paper or on the computer as I was in the Engineering Academy throughout all of high school. I decided to apply to NJIT because it has a good architecture program and was the only place that was not too far.
